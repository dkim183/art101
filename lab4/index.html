		<pre><code>
			<h2> // Drawing the Human Figure: </h2>
		1. Get a piece of paper or anything to draw on such as a tablet, etc.
		2. Lightly draw the strongest direction or gesture of the pose you're going for.
		3. Then, lightly block in the head, torso, pelvis, legs, etc.
			- Don't care about the details, only focus on the bigger picture or the structure of the body like how you do.
			- Think of this step as the HTML and the details as css
		4. After blocking in the main structures, lightly sketch secondary structures such as the eyes, mouth, muscles, glasses, clothes, etc.
		5. Then, shade in the third structures such as details like veins, textures, creases, etc.
		6. After blocking in everything, render the drawing and make it clean by shading stuff in or making things or 3-dimensional.
		7. Finished!
